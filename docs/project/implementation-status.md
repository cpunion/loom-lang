# Implementation status

Only the native compiler under `compiler/` is maintained. Its
[guide](../../compiler/README.md) lists the tested subset and commands.
The former workspace compiler and its feature matrices have been removed.

The active compiler has a real source-to-native check/build/test/run path,
package/test isolation, concrete generic records/enums, shared lists, UTF-8
text, real file reads/writes and stdout, scalar constrained construction, and
mandatory postconditions within a bounded proof fragment. The Loom-written
frontend handles source and manifests, package loading, syntax, binding, typing,
proof, and checked program emission. Focused managed tests force collection
before every allocation. Constants and safe scalar weakening avoid
redundant checks; unknown construction returns an ordinary source `Result`.
Postfix `?` propagates errors with ordinary enum control flow. Recursive data
through `List` is supported; infinite inline layouts and growing generic
specializations reject.

The native gate uses macOS, Rust 1.88, and LLVM 19. Compiler, native integration,
and runtime tests cover real check/build/test/run, required-proof rejection,
input-boundary failures, and allocation-free scalar/record paths.
The [Loom-written compiler](../../compiler/loom/README.md) now compiles its own
sources: an existing compiler (stage 0) produces stage 1, stage 1 produces
stage 2, and stage 2 produces stage 3. These are build generations, not language
versions. Stage 2 and stage 3 executables are byte-identical on the
validated macOS development build. Stage 3 passes compiler, `std`, and example
package tests and runs the data example. Stages 2 and 3 agree on selected
type/proof failure diagnostics. This gate combines the
[bootstrap script](../../scripts/bootstrap.sh) and
[frontend integration test](../../compiler/tests/frontend.rs). The source
checker also checks its complete package closure, selected `std` packages,
and the scalar/data examples.

The source frontend sends a checked artifact to one retained Rust LLVM/platform
tool; that tool does not parse or type-check Loom source again. The Rust seed
frontend is no longer active source. A pinned historical commit can build a
cached stage 0 when no existing Loom compiler is supplied; this fallback is
not a compatibility commitment or a second frontend to extend. Rust remains
for the LLVM/platform boundary and runtime, not a permanent basic language.
The compiler and independent user packages now share the public
[`std.loom.source`, `lexer`, `ast`, and `parser` libraries](../../compiler/loom/README.md#public-syntax-libraries).
The standalone syntax example passes native check/build/test/run and inspects
in-memory declarations, byte spans, and diagnostics without compiler imports.
The opt-in [manifest, project, and binding libraries](../../compiler/loom/README.md#public-project-and-binding-libraries)
also share the compiler's implementation. They load selected import closures,
validate declarations/imports, and expose symbols and visible name candidates.
An ordinary project inspector accepts a package path and `std` directory,
reports root declarations and source locations, and handles load/binding errors
without a compiler subprocess. Binding is not type checking or final overload
selection; its indices belong to that program only. The additional
[typed analysis library](../../compiler/loom/README.md#public-typed-analysis)
shares the checker/prover, returning inferred expression types and concrete call
targets. Its ordinary semantic example uses only in-memory source and detects
snapshot changes. Queries cover concrete instances; snapshot comparison does
not monitor files or provide incremental reuse.

[Compile-time execution](../../compiler/README.md#compile-time-execution) uses a
bounded Loom evaluator over the native compiler's checked model. Explicit
blocks support pure calls, local mutation, loops/recursion, and scalar or
record/enum results, including shared lists/bytes. Every runtime evaluation
constructs a fresh graph with its internal aliases and cycles preserved; no
hidden mutable global is introduced. Successful pure results can be reused
within one check, not across builds. `comptime if` selects code using a computed Boolean or type
equality/inequality. Runtime captures, external effects, faults, and exhausted
budgets reject. Scalar constraint folding shares this evaluator; required
postconditions still use the prover, with no evaluation-as-proof fallback.

Stable schemas, lossless editing, variadics, typed macros, broader compile-time
reflection, and contract reasoning remain in the
[roadmap](../../ROADMAP.md#n2--complete-the-language-and-source-library).

Normal compiler iteration can use a [single development rebuild](../../compiler/README.md#build-and-try-it);
CI retains full bootstrap generation checks. The initial
[latency harness](../../compiler/README.md#compiler-latency) measures fresh-process
check/build runs with warm OS caches and backend phase timings. It does not
implement incremental reuse or establish a performance target as achieved.

Accepted language and deployment decisions remain targets, not claims that the
whole design is implemented. Bootstrap agreement is not a correctness proof.
No release, full platform matrix, or complete standard library is claimed.
